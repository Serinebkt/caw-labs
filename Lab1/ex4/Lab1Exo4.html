    <h1>Web Development Fundamentals</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a web page.</p>
    
    <h2>CSS Styling</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style and layout web pages. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size of text, spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves content accessibility and provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.</p>
